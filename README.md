## About Tool
This code is a Python program that calculates and plots the Shear Force Diagram (SFD) and Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) for a simply supported beam under a uniform distributed load. The user is prompted to input values for the load, length of the beam, and the lengths of the two segments.

The program then calculates the reactions at the supports, and uses these values to calculate the shear force and bending moment at different points along the beam. The shear force and bending moment data are stored in lists, which are used to plot the SFD and BMD using the matplotlib library.

The program also includes a basic GUI interface using the tkinter library, which allows the user to input values for the beam parameters and see the resulting plots.
